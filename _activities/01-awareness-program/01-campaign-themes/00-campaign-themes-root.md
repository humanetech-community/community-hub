## About

Every campaign has a **Theme** and themes can have multiple campaigns. Themes have high-level, long-term objectives to be attained by execution of their related Campaigns. Hence they are long-lived and determine the focus and scope of the campaigns that adhere to the theme.

Every Humane Tech Community member can suggest new Themes by posting in the [Awareness program](https://community.humanetech.com/c/awareness-program).
